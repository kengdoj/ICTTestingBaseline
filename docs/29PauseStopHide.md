###### Test Case

###### Output
Each element tested will return a test result of pass or fail for eash test case as well as a description of any errors causing a failure result. 
/[Test case results are combined with other test case results to provide a cumulative outcome, pass or fail, of the rule. When a rule has multiple test cases, the results of all test cases are combined to give a single result for each selected item. The results are cumulative, meaning that as long as one test case passes, the rule has passed./]
/[If either one of these passed, the rule has passed. Only if both fail, does that element fail the rule./]

##### Outcome
The overall test procedure (accumulating the results of the individual test cases) should return one of the following outcomes:
* Passed – the test target passed the test
* Failed – the test target failed the test
* Cannot tell: it is unclear whether or not the test target passes or fails the test
